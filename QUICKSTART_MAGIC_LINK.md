## Step 1: Deploy Email Template to Supabase (5 minutes)

1. **Open the email template:**
   ```bash
   open email-templates/magic-link.html
   ```
   
2. **Copy the entire HTML content** (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)

3. **Go to Supabase Dashboard:**
   - Navigate to: https://glhwxyhhycqytfrsjzyz.supabase.co
   - Click **Authentication** → **Email Templates**
   - Select **Magic Link** template

4. **Paste and configure:**
   - Paste the HTML into the template editor
   - Set subject: `Sign in to WayPath ACT Prep`
   - Click **Save**

5. **Configure redirect URLs:**
   - Go to **Authentication** → **URL Configuration**
   - Add redirect URLs:
     - Production: `https://act-prep-web.vercel.app/auth/callback`
     - Development: `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`
   - Save changes

## Step 2: Test Locally (2 minutes)

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Open in browser:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

3. **Test the magic link flow:**

   - Click the "Sign In to ACT Prep" button
   - Complete your profile (if first time)
   - You're in!
