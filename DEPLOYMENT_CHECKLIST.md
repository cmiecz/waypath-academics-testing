2. **Add Password Option**
   - Re-enable password fields in LoginPage
   - Add "Sign in with Password" option
   - Keep magic link as alternative

3. **Full Rollback** (Last Resort)
   - Revert LoginPage.tsx to previous version
   - Revert App.tsx routes
   - Update Supabase email template back
   - Users can use password auth again
