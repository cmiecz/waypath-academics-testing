# Magic Link Authentication Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented passwordless magic link authentication to replace the traditional email/password system. Users now receive a branded email with a one-click sign-in link, providing a better user experience and enhanced security.

## What Changed

### 1. Authentication API (`src/api/auth.ts`)
**New Functions Added:**
- `signInWithMagicLink(email)` - Sends magic link to user's email
- `handleMagicLinkCallback(tokenHash, type)` - Verifies magic link and handles user session
- `createUserProfile(userId, name, email, grade)` - Creates user profile for new users

**Key Features:**
- Auto-detects environment (dev/prod) for redirect URLs
- Automatic user creation on first sign-in
- Checks if user profile exists and routes accordingly
- Handles both new and returning users seamlessly

### 2. Login Page (`src/pages/LoginPage.tsx`)
**Simplified to Magic Link Flow:**
- Removed password fields and sign-up form
- Single email input field
- "Send Magic Link" button

- Kept admin login and testing mode buttons

**User Experience:**
- Clear instructions: "Sign in with your email - no password needed!"
- Help text explaining the process
- Email field auto-focused for faster interaction

### 3. New Pages Created

### 4. App Routes (`src/App.tsx`)
**New Routes Added:**

- `/complete-profile` ‚Üí `ProfileCompletionPage`

**Route Flow:**
```
/ (login) ‚Üí /auth/callback ‚Üí /complete-profile (new) or /test-selection (existing)
```
