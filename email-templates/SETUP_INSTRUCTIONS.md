## Troubleshooting

**Q: I saved the template but still see the old email**  
A: Clear your cache and try signing in again. The new template should apply immediately to new sign-in requests.

**Q: The styling looks broken in the email**  
A: Make sure you copied the ENTIRE template including all the `<style>` tags at the top.

**Q: Can I customize it further?**  
A: Yes! Edit `magic-link.html` and re-upload. Just keep the `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}` variable intact.
